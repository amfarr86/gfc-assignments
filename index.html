					<p>
					Wild Onions is a farm-to-table kitchen offering a refined, yet casual, menu.
					We strive to bring you the best sensory experience possible by presenting you
					with beautifully crafted dishes and drinks, including house-made tonics, local
					craft beer, and thoughtfully prepared cocktails. Our menu changes with the seasons
					and based on availability. A complete list of local produce and protein providers for 
					the day's menu can be found on our "Local Farms" chalkboard above our bar area. Wild 
					Onions is situated in a rural setting, off a dirt road, and offers an intimate dining
					room, bar area, and patio seating, with each option complete with stunning views of the 
					lush scenery. For catering inquiries, private party information, or for any questions, 
					please follow the "Contact Us" link at the top of this page.
